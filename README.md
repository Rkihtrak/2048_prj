# 2048_prj
2048 game made in python

The game is complete on the terminal.
It works like the 2048 game you find online, or on your phone.

As stated, the gui was an extra challenge. The setup portion was done, however the callbacks do not work completely. The 2048 portion was challenging
enough for 3 group members, so the gui was left at where it is now. You can run the gui to see how it would look/start up. It just doesnt do the shifts.
Also, you will need Tkinter packages in order to run the gui.
